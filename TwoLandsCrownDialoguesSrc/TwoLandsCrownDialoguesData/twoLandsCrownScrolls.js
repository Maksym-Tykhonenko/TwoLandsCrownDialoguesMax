        title: "The Double Crown and the Unifier",
        content: "Once, I wore the Two Lands upon my brow. But do you know who first placed it there?",
        story: "The story unfolds in a haze of memory. A battle of banners, one red, one white, rising over the Nile. The mummy recalls whispers of a king called Narmer—known to some as Menes—who joined Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom more than five thousand years ago.\n\nThis was no small act. For centuries the Nile had nurtured two separate realms. In the south, the White Crown reigned over fertile fields and narrow valleys. In the north, the Red Crown watched over the Delta's wide waters. To bind them meant not only war, but vision.\n\nOn the Narmer Palette—an ancient carved slab—you can still see the triumph: the king striking down enemies on one side, and on the other, wearing both crowns together. That symbol, the Double Crown, became the emblem of pharaohs for three thousand years.",
        lesson: "So when you see me crowned, you do not see me alone—you see the dream of one land, one river, one people."

        title: "The Stone That Spoke Three Tongues",
        content: "The mummy tells of wandering in silence long after tomb robbers had stripped chambers bare. Yet once, in the land of the living, a stone cried out across time.",
        story: "In the town of Rosetta, in 1799, French soldiers stumbled upon a dark slab of granodiorite. On its face: the same decree carved three ways—hieroglyphs, Demotic script, and Greek. For the mummy, it was as if a sealed mouth had opened. 'The gods had hidden our voices, but this stone became the key.'\n\nScholars puzzled over it for years, until Jean-François Champollion, with fierce determination, matched Greek names to hieroglyphic symbols. By 1822 he had cracked the code, giving the world back the lost language of pharaohs.",
        lesson: "Without that stone, my riddles would be silence. Without that stone, the cartouche that guards royal names would remain unread. Remember this: even the smallest shard can hold the power of ages."

        title: "The Valley Where Kings Sleep",
        content: "In a dream of desert cliffs, the mummy leads the seeker down a hidden wadi west of the Nile. The air is heavy, the stones burn with sun, but the silence is sacred.",
        story: "The Valley of the Kings, near ancient Thebes, became the royal necropolis of Egypt's New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE). Instead of massive pyramids, pharaohs dug their tombs deep into limestone hills, corridors painted with spells from the Book of the Dead, ceilings turned into starry skies.\n\nOver sixty tombs have been found here, some stretching hundreds of feet underground. The most famous is Tutankhamun's, discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, still holding treasures undreamed of: golden mask, alabaster shrines, jeweled sandals, even toys of the boy king.",
        lesson: "Here, I too once walked as guardian. The valley is a labyrinth of doors that never open unless the name of the king is spoken true. Speak rightly, and the dead live on. Speak falsely, and silence devours you."

        title: "The Festival of the Running Pharaoh",
        content: "The mummy chuckles softly. 'Even kings grew old, and the gods demanded proof of their strength.'",
        story: "He tells of the Sed Festival, one of Egypt's oldest and strangest rites. After thirty years of rule, a pharaoh was expected to renew his power through a ritual race. Wearing the crowns of both lands, the king had to dash across a courtyard, symbolically proving he could still govern with vigor.\n\nThe ceremony was no mere sport. It was a declaration of divine right, a reassurance to gods and people that the ruler remained chosen. Temples at Saqqara and Karnak still show scenes of kings running between markers, sometimes with priests trailing behind.\n\n'I remember watching from shadow,' says the mummy. 'The king, robes heavy, sweat on his brow, but eyes burning bright. Each step told the gods: I am still your vessel, your power still flows through me.'",
        lesson: "The Sed Festival reminds the seeker that Egypt's greatness was not built only on stone and river, but on rituals of renewal. So too must you prove yourself, again and again, until the chains break."

        title: "The River That Measured Time",
        content: "The mummy gestures as if tracing a line across the desert floor. 'More than stone or crown, the Nile was our clock.'",
        story: "Every year, the river would rise in a sacred rhythm. The inundation, called Akhet, spread black silt across the fields, renewing the land. Farmers watched for the star Sirius, appearing before dawn, to mark the flood's approach. It was not chance—it was the heartbeat of Egypt itself.\n\nPriests built nilometers, stairways cut into stone banks, to measure the water's rise. A high flood promised abundance; a low one warned of hunger. Taxes, offerings, even the calendars of temples, all turned on the Nile's measure.\n\n'I remember walking to the river's edge, hearing children laugh as the waters climbed. We did not see just a flood. We saw Hapi, the river god, bringing life in his blue hands. Without him, even crowns and temples would crumble into dust.'",
        lesson: "Remember this: power is not only gold or armies. Sometimes, it is the rhythm of water."

        title: "The Book of Doors",
        content: "In the Chamber, the mummy unfurls a phantom scroll. 'Beyond death, there is no single gate. There are many doors, and each must be named.'",
        story: "He speaks of the funerary texts known as the Book of Gates and the Book of the Dead. These were not mere prayers—they were maps for the soul. Painted on tomb walls or written on papyrus, they guided the deceased through the Duat, the underworld, where each hour of night brought new trials.\n\nThere were gates guarded by serpents, lakes of fire, and halls where hearts were weighed against the feather of Ma'at. To speak the correct spell or know the right name was to pass unharmed. To falter was to be devoured.\n\nThe mummy recalls painting glyphs in a pharaoh's tomb: falcons with outspread wings, scarabs rolling the sun through darkness, stars that shimmered even underground. 'Every picture was a weapon against fear. Every word was a key.'",
        lesson: "So when I ask riddles of you, it is no game. It is the same ancient trial: to speak the right word, to open the right door, and to step forward still alive."
